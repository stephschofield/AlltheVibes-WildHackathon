## How to contribute to the All the Vibes Agent Swarm

### 1. Get the repo

The shared repository is public:

```
shyamsridhar123/AlltheVibes-WildHackathon
```

You can clone it directly, or fork it if you don't have push access.

```bash
# Clone directly
git clone https://github.com/shyamsridhar123/AlltheVibes-WildHackathon.git

# Or fork first, then clone your fork
gh repo fork shyamsridhar123/AlltheVibes-WildHackathon --clone
```

---

### 2. Choose how you'll contribute

You can contribute **anything**. It does not have to be a full agent.

Explicitly allowed contributions:

- ✅ Agents
- ✅ Partial agents
- ✅ Skills
- ✅ Utilities, experiments, or helpers
- ✅ Any code that fits the "agent swarm" idea

There was **no required tech stack, language, or architecture.**

---

### 3. Make a change quickly

The live guidance emphasized **speed over polish**.
The expectation during the session was:

> **Push something every ~5 minutes**

Small, rough, or experimental changes are totally fine.

---

### 4. Push your change (two valid paths)

**Option A — You have push access**
- Commit directly to the repo
- Push to `main` (main branch protection was intentionally off)

**Option B — You do NOT have push access** (most common)
- Fork the repo
- Make your changes in your fork
- Open a Pull Request back to the main repo

```bash
# Quick PR from fork
git add -A
git commit -m "🐝 my swarm contribution"
git push origin main
gh pr create --repo shyamsridhar123/AlltheVibes-WildHackathon --title "🐝 my contribution" --body "vibes"
```

This was confirmed live and reiterated in chat.

---

### 5. Pull requests are intentionally lightweight

- Pull requests are allowed
- **GitHub Copilot** was explicitly framed as the approver
- Human review gates were intentionally relaxed
- Breaking changes were considered acceptable during the session

---

### 6. Don't overthink standards

The following were **explicitly not defined**:

- ❌ Coding standards
- ❌ Linting rules
- ❌ Ownership after the session
- ❌ Cleanup expectations
- ❌ Final demo or success criteria

**The goal was momentum and experimentation, not correctness.**
