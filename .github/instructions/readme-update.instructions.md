# README Update Instructions

## When to Update
- After new features are added
- When the project structure changes significantly
- When setup/installation steps change
- After breaking changes

## README Sections to Maintain
1. **Title & Description** — What the project does
2. **Quick Start** — How to get running in < 5 minutes
3. **Project Structure** — Current directory layout
4. **Recent Changes** — Link to or summary of latest changes from CHANGELOG.md
5. **Contributing** — How to contribute and documentation expectations

## Rules
- Keep the README concise and scannable
- Update the project structure section when directories are added/removed
- Never remove the "Recent Changes" section link to CHANGELOG.md
- Use relative links for all internal file references
